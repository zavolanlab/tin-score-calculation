----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program calculates transcript integrity number (TIN) for each transcript
(or gene) in BED file. TIN is conceptually similar to RIN
(RNA integrity number) but provides transcript level measurement of RNA quality
and is more sensitive to measure low quality RNA samples:

1) TIN score of a transcript is used to measure the RNA integrity
    of the transcript.
2) Median TIN score across all transcripts can be used to measure RNA integrity
    of that "RNA sample".
3) TIN ranges from 0 (the worst) to 100 (the best). TIN = 60 means: 60% of the
    transcript has been covered if the reads coverage were uniform.
4) TIN will be assigned to 0 if the transcript has no coverage or covered reads
    is fewer than cutoff.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT_FILES, --input=INPUT_FILES
                        Input BAM file(s). "-i" takes these input: 1) a single
                        BAM file. 2) "," separated BAM files (no spaces
                        allowed). 3) directory containing one or more bam
                        files. 4) plain text file containing the path of one
                        or more bam files (Each row is a BAM file path). All
                        BAM files should be sorted and indexed using samtools.
                        [required]
  -r REF_GENE_MODEL, --refgene=REF_GENE_MODEL
                        Reference gene model in BED format. Must be strandard
                        12-column BED file. [required]
  -c MINIMUM_COVERAGE, --minCov=MINIMUM_COVERAGE
                        Minimum number of read mapped to a transcript.
                        default=10
  -n SAMPLE_SIZE, --sample-size=SAMPLE_SIZE
                        Number of equal-spaced nucleotide positions picked
                        from mRNA. Note: if this number is larger than the
                        length of mRNA (L), it will be halved until it's
                        smaller than L. default=100
  --names=SAMPLE_NAMES  sample names, comma separated (no spaces allowed);
                        number must match the number of provided bam_files
  -s, --subtract-background
                        Subtract background noise (estimated from intronic
                        reads). Only use this option if there are substantial
                        intronic reads.
